# StudyBuddy

An interactive AI assistant which summarises text documents and explains them using a seminar format, where the AI will talk through the document whilst allowing for anyone in the crowd who is listening to put their hand up to ask a question.

## Goals

- Summarise text on a page (need some sort of granularity that can be controlled)
- Text-To-Speech the summarised text document
- Click button to ask a question which is converted using Speech-To-Text and fed into the AI
- Allow a room to be created using a code so several people can join the session
